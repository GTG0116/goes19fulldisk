        warmer than PRECIP_CLOUD_MAX_K and are scored as zero.
      • The result is therefore biased towards the convective part of the rain
        field.  Light stratiform rain falling from tops in the 240–260 K range
        is scored below the display threshold and simply disappears, so the
        rain area is too small and the surviving area skews heavy.  Read this
        as "where is the deep convection and roughly how hard is it", not as a
        complete rainfall map.
      • Cold cirrus that is not raining can still be scored as rain when the
        texture and water-vapour screens fail to catch it.
      • No parallax correction, so cold tops are displaced from the rain
        beneath them by tens of km at high latitudes and near the limb.
      • Nothing is estimated beyond ~75° satellite zenith angle, so the outer
        ring of the disk is intentionally blank.
      • The Auto-Estimator regression was fitted over the continental US in
        summer; it over-predicts in dry environments and under-predicts in
        moist tropical ones.  The operational Hydro-Estimator corrects this
